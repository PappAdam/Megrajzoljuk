The program allows users to build programs with various variables and commands, the output of which is displayed as an image on a canvas. Users can use pre-built blocks such as control structures (e.g. if, for, while), calculations, mathematical operations, drawing and debugging, etc. The program allows easy dragging and dropping of blocks to allow users to edit the program easily and quickly.

The program has an intuitive user interface that allows users to immediately see the output of the program. The result is displayed as an image on the canvas, allowing users to view and examine the program output. The image is saved in png format, which allows users to share the results of the program with others.

Overall, the program allows users to build programs containing various variables and commands and examine the output on a canvas. The ease of use of the program allows anyone to easily and efficiently build programs without the need to have any coding knowledge.
